Problem Statement 1:

1-API Data Retrieval and Storage📂:fetch_books_api.py

2-Data Processing and Visualization📂: student_scores_analysis.py

3-CSV Data Import to a Database📂:csv_to_db.py

4-complex python code written - https://github.com/sanjay-2605/Job-rec-AI/blob/main/app.py

Code: main code regarding my personal project named Job recommondation AI app

Most Complex Python Code:

AI-based Job Recommendation System built using Python and Streamlit.
The application takes user skills as input, performs TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match skills with job requirements and generates personalized career guidance using an LLM API. The project integrates data processing, machine learning techniques, API usage and an interactive UI in a single application.

5- complex database code-

Code:https://github.com/sanjay-2605/Personal-Finance-Tracker-Project/blob/main/sql_db.sql

Most Compelex DataBase code:

This SQL script defines a normalized database schema for a personal finance tracker application. It includes tables for users, categories and transactions, designed with appropriate primary keys and foreign keys to model relationships. The script also includes sample data inserts and analytical queries that compute total income, total expenses, category-wise spending breakdown and remaining balance. These analytical queries demonstrate the use of SQL joins, aggregations and conditional filtering. The schema and queries together show practical use of SQL that could support dashboard reporting or backend data summaries in a finance app.

Problem Statement 2:

1-Where would you rate yourself on (LLM, Deep Learning, AI, ML). A, B, C [A = can code independently; B = can code under supervision; C = have little or no understanding]

| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | **B**  | I have a practical understanding of AI concepts such as problem formulation, rule-based systems, and ML-driven decision making. I can build basic AI applications and integrate existing AI tools under supervision while continuing to strengthen fundamentals.               |
| **Machine Learning (ML)**        | **B**  | I understand core ML concepts including supervised and unsupervised learning, feature extraction, model evaluation, and basic algorithms. I can implement ML solutions with guidance and have hands-on exposure through small projects and experimentation.                    |
| **Deep Learning (DL)**           | **C**  | I have a foundational theoretical understanding of neural networks and deep learning concepts, but limited hands-on implementation experience. I am actively learning architectures and training workflows to move toward practical usage.                                     |
| **Large Language Models (LLMs)** | **B**  | I have a conceptual understanding of how LLMs work, including prompting and basic API usage, but limited experience building end-to-end LLM systems independently. I am currently focusing on learning LLM architectures, prompt design and integration patterns such as RAG. |
